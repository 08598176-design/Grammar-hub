/* ============================================================
   JAPANESE HUB — GRAMMAR CONTENT
   ------------------------------------------------------------
   Instructional text (prompts, options, explanations) is English.
   Japanese is used only for the sentences, particles and target
   vocabulary. See SPEC.md §6.

   THE SEQUENCE. window.JP_CHUNKS at the foot of this file is the
   Prep-to-Year-12 timeline: one chunk per teaching step, placed on
   the year axis, grouped into strands. A strand runs across several
   years, each chunk building on the one before it — that is what
   the year view renders, and what makes the order visible.

   RULE: within a strand the year axis must never contradict the
   teaching order. The generator asserts this.

   PRIMARY CONTENT (Prep-Year 8) is a PROPOSAL for Andrew. The
   Victorian Curriculum F-10 Japanese names no specific grammar at
   any band, so only the SCRIPT strand's sequence is directly
   curriculum-backed (recognise 3 scripts -> copy hiragana ->
   familiar katakana and kanji -> role of each script -> compounds
   and multiple readings). Everything else is standard Australian
   primary Japanese scope and needs his tick. Primary cells use
   identify/order tasks only — no typed Japanese, since a Year 2
   has no IME and typing is not the skill being tested.

   Before committing, run the sanity check in SPEC.md §9. It must
   print "problems 0".
